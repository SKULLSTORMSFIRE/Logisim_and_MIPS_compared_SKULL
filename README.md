# Logisim_and_MIPS_compared_SKULL
This the computer architecture project I did this was by far my favourite and I managed to get 88% for this.

The guide for downloading logisim is here: http://www.cburch.com/logisim/download.html
This is a cpu architecture study tool to help people like me understand how they are created.

and to download the code editor for mips is here: http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/
This is just some assembly thing to compare it with

(ik they look dodgy but it is the real deal)
